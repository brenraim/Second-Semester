This is a javascript snake game that I made after failing to progress swiftly in my Tron Project. After running into trouble trying to manage a local network of different users for a LAN Tron game, I thought it would be a better use of my time to instead work on the basics of the game and start by coding a snake game. Both games have lines that travel on a grid and involve managing collisions, so this project was a good use of my time.

The project can be run by having all of the files in this folder in the same location on your computer and then opening the html file with a browser (usually just double clicking the html file will work). The game is played with arrow keys and is fully functioning.
