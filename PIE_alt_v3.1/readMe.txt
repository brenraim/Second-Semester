For the second semester, I worked to combine the separate extensions for PIE into one extension. The end result was an added functionality where the user can click on the PIE icon in the top right of Chrome to toggle between the two versions. This is part of my plan to have only one extension available by next year.

The process involved the design of a popup window, management of a new cookie, and other logistical issues that came with the change. I also added some minor design changes that I believe improve the overall look of the extension.

You can run my code by putting chrome into developer mode and moving the files to the designated folder, or the easier option would be to just install the extension by searching “Pingry” in the Chrome Web Store or use a computer that already has the extension installed.
